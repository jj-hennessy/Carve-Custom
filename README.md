# Carve-Custom Description
Code Authors: JJ Hennessy, Dhruva Bansal, and Rajas Bansal

This project served as the MVP of a Stanford-based startup named Carve. This MVP was created throughout March and April of 2021. Carve's goal was to deliver highly-personalized and data-driven snow ski recommendations.

This repository houses a collection of the Python scripts which perform 4 different functions. These include:
1. Ingest data from a Qualtrics survey filled out by a customer containing information about the customer's height, ski style, preferred ski length, and other preferences
2. Input a user's data into a custom-designed algorithm implemented in Excel to provide a list of the top 10 ski recommendations custom-tailored for that customer
3. Create a Python-generated Excel spreadsheet with the customer's recommendations, links to purchase each ski, statistics about those skis, and more
4. Send the customer an email with their recommendation file and a short message using Python.
