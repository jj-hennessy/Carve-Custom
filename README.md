# Carve-Custom Description
This project served as the MVP of a Stanford-based startup named Carve. Carve's goal was to deliver highly-personalized and data-driven ski recommendations.

This repository houses a collection of the Python scripts which ultimately grabbed data from a Qualtrics survey which contained information about
the customer's height, ski style, preferred ski length, and other metrics and then used a custom-designed algorithm implemented in Excel to provide
a list of the top 10 ski recommendations custom-tailored for that person. 

The final recommendation was delivered in a Python-generated Excel spreadsheet with the customer's recommendation, links to purchase each ski, statistics
about those skis, and more. Finally, this recommendation file was delivered via an email sent using Python.
